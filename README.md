# Gas and Temperature Tracker

This is a fun little project that tracks daily gas levels and temperatures over the course of a year. Perfect for anyone who loves to monitor their bodily functions (we won't judge).

## How It Works

We've got a dataset with 365 Days of gas readings and the corresponding temperatures. We've visualized this data using Matplotlib to create two graphs, one for gas and one for temperature. You can hover over each data point to see the specific readings for that day.

## To be added

The next step is to develop an AI that predicts how Germany's gas reserves develop based on temperature.

## Installation

You'll need Python and a few libraries installed to run this project. Don't worry, it's super easy! Just follow these steps:

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.  Install the required libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal.
3.  Run the script with `python main.py`.

And that's it! You're all set to track your gas and temperature like a pro.
